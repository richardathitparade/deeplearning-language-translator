English to french translator
Open the Jupyter Notebook and enjoy!

This is a french to english translater using deep learning methods.
1. I made some modifications on this version.
   In sentence_to_seq I used list comprehension.
2. Used  tf.strided_slice to in process_decoded_input
3. I made sure I imported and checked in all of the floydhub files and results instead of my local so that the 
sentence_to_seq tests are available.
